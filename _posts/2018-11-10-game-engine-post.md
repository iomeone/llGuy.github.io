`Hello world!`

This is my first post. For a long time, I have been extremely interested in the architecture of game engines. I tried to make a game previously(which I have a post about, it's called Landscaper), however, I wanted to develop an actual little game engine for me to use when developing games. This game engine will treat all the issues that I encountered in my experience in making games. This game engine will feature support for :

- 3D scenes
- guis (font rendering, etc...)
- component system for entities
- flexible model system and shader system
- post processing effects - bloom, DoF
- programmable post processing pipeline
- shadows
- defered shading
- reflective surfaces
- 3D skeletal animation
- networking

All this will be done in C++ and OpenGL.
